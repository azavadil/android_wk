The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid\n
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics\n
Articulate, but still\'ll grab a nigga by the collar quick\n
Whoever havin problems with their record sales just holler Tip\n
If that don\'t work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip\n
