        Programming is a craft. At its simplest, it comes down to getting a
	computer to do what you want it to do (or what your user wants it to do). As
	a programmer, you are part listener, part advisor, part interpreter, and
	part dictator. You try to capture elusive requirements and find a way of
	expressing them so that a mere machine can do them justice. You try to
	document your work so that others can understand it, and you try to
	engineer your work so that others can build on it. What\'s more, you try to do
	all this against the relentless ticking of the project clock. You work small
	miracles every day.
